I think, in no uncertain terms that decentralised social media is the future of online community and communication. The traditional server-client model brings about
an intrinsic conflict between content and moderator that cannot be resolved. It brings to the forefront not just "tribes of people" but a heiracrchy of who-is-who,
determined by their supposed influence. Influence created.. through often times mirrors of real-world heirarchy. Relationships abstracted away as connection points on a graph.
"Influencers" are a modern concept. A culture born from the internet.

The future is less.

Meaningful conversation. Deeper richer topics. Less of a publishing medium. More a way to understand and model real life connections. 

Niches.

Community is always about niches. Now more than ever, the concept of a follower becomes meaningless. What we want are connections. These overlap but are never the same thing.

I want to create a place a way to talk to my friends about interesting things and not get bored.

I don't want to be caught in the trap of competing for social status. 

I also want to meet new people, sometimes randomly. 

The point I think... is about connection. 

Finding some way to express some basic human truth to another person and hope the message isn't lost along the way. This I think is all that there is.

I want... I care about the people I know.

But I care about the people I don't know and want to know... could know. If I wanted.

A place that encouraged that. A kind of human place. I could get lost and curate the cutest, silliest, most authentic creations.

By people I cared about. That sounds nice. 

Every social media I know of misses the point. I don't want to be forced into a private conversation without having what to say. Social anxiety exists both ways.

People have lots of things to say to each other I think.

Alot of people struggle with expressing themselves, I don't to be broadcasted to. I want to be talked to. I want.. to engage in meaningful discourse.

Forums miss the point to. There it's about information. It's not. It's about people and the things we say to each other in our little niches.
